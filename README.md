## Concept

### What is a city?

When we look over a group of buildings in the distance, they appear to be images without any sense of three-dimensionality. It is also the image that evokes the memory of the city. And urban textures are reproduced through various mediums. In other words, a city is a reproducible image.
The image of the city that we construct in our brains is a worm-eaten map, and that map is distorted and misaligned. Each of us has our own image of the city, which is caused by our memory of the place and our physical sensation of it. Reimagining the city in terms of subjective images allows us to free ourselves from physical locality. Nevertheless, there is a certain degree of universality in the objects we perceive, and it is the buildings and other objects in the city that carry this universality. Objects that are recognized by many observers eventually become "public objects. In memory, "public objects" do not depend on the authority of any public institution and are free. Public objects are authenticated by the people of the city.

### The City in the Age of Reproduction Technology

Today, it is commonplace to take pictures with smartphones. The photos are then uploaded to social networking sites and spread. The image of the city is spreading through replication after replication. Herein lies the sincere desire of modern people to bring things closer to them, both spatially and humanly. The modern person cannot avoid the demand to duplicate and possess things that are close at hand in his or her daily life. In the modern city, information and kinetic energy are exchanged: you see a post on a social networking site, you go to that place. They see a post on a social networking site, go to that place, and post a photo. Repeated reproductions drive people's behavior. As if marking one's visit and informing one's friends of it, taking out one's smartphone and taking a picture becomes an affordance in front of the object.

### Digital vernacularity

The virtual images of cities that we construct in our brains allow for an interactive exchange of information by being free from physical locality. For example, if you are able to take an impressive photograph of a place and place it on the spot, most people will not be able to share that impression. However, if something like a bulletin board in the city were to exist digitally, the possibility of sharing that impression with many people would increase. By freeing ourselves from physical locality, we will be able to create a vernacular map that can only be done digitally. This is not a map that reflects reality, but a map that is an accumulation of people's memories. Therefore, the images are scattered in a worm-eaten pattern, and the map will always be incomplete.

### The Narrow Internet

Today, the technological development of reproduction has made it easy to establish a public image. However, if we subdivide a city into smaller parts, there must be many maniacal urban objects that are still lying dormant. And their charms can only be discovered by going deep into the land. And this is not something that can be done by a single observer walking around a city. ONE MAP is an interface where a city suspended from its location is covered by a city with a physical space, and interacts with the world.
